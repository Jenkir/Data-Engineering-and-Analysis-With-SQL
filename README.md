# SQL - Data Engineering and Analysis
Analyzing an Employee Database

For this assignment, we were required to complete a research project on employees of a corporation, Pewlett Hackard, from the 1980's and 1990s.
The data was included in six csv files. 
The process included the following:
In PgAdmin, I created tables to hold the csv data and then imported the csvs into an SQL database.
Then, I used quickdatabasediagrams.com to create a table schema for the six csv files which included specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys,
and other constraints:



The queries.sql file contains the queries that I performed on the tables. For example, in the first query, I listed details for each employee that included employee
number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
